## What is Statistical Inference?

Statistical inference is the process of using data from a sample to make conclusions about a larger population. It's one of the core concepts in statistics.

## Key Concepts

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing allows us to make decisions or draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data.

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter, along with a level of confidence.

### P-Values

Understanding p-values is crucial for interpreting statistical tests correctly.

## Practical Applications

Statistical inference is used in:

- Clinical trials
- Quality control
- Survey analysis
- A/B testing
- Scientific research

## Conclusion

Mastering statistical inference opens up powerful tools for making data-driven decisions. We'll explore these topics in more depth in future posts.
